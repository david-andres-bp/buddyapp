Technical & Branding Document: ConnectSphere Theme
This document outlines the design philosophy, branding, architecture, and required pages for the "ConnectSphere" theme, a lightweight, real-time social media application built on the CodePress platform.
1. Theme Vision & Philosophy
"ConnectSphere" transforms the CodePress platform into a fast-paced, content-centric social network, blending the immediacy of Twitter with the capacity for slightly more detailed posts and community interaction found on Facebook. The core vision is to create a dynamic "public square" where information flows freely and users can easily follow topics and personalities.
Primary Goal: To facilitate a real-time public conversation, prioritizing speed, clarity, and content discovery.
Core Experience: A chronological, endlessly scrolling feed of posts from followed accounts, supplemented by trending topics and user discovery features.
Key Differentiator: The "Pinned Profiles" feature, allowing users to create a persistent, custom shortcut to view the feeds of their favorite accounts.
2. Branding & UI/UX
The branding is designed to feel modern, clean, efficient, and trustworthy.
Tone & Voice: Direct, energetic, and informative. The interface should feel like a tool for information, not just entertainment.
Color Palette:
Primary/Accent (#38BDF8 - Sky Blue): Used for links, buttons, and active states to draw attention and encourage interaction.
Dark UI (#1E293B - Slate Gray): Used for the main navigation and sidebars to create a stable, focused frame for the content.
Background (#F1F5F9 - Light Gray): A soft, neutral background for the main content area to ensure readability and reduce eye strain.
Text (#0F172A - Near Black): High-contrast, readable text.
Typography:
Primary Font: Inter. A clean, modern, and highly readable sans-serif font used for all UI elements, from headlines to body copy.
UI/UX Principles:
Information Density: A three-column layout on desktop (User/Navigation | Main Feed | Discovery/Trends) maximizes the use of space.
Content-First Cards: Posts are displayed in clean, self-contained cards with clear metadata and subtle action icons.
Mobile-First Collapse: The layout seamlessly collapses to a single, intuitive column on mobile devices.
Intuitive Actions: "Like," "Comment," and "Share" are immediately accessible but visually unobtrusive.
